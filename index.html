<!-- Transition properties are applied on the element  not on the hover property. Animations are applied in the hover. -->
<!-- Transition has a default name(transition timing function) of linear, while animations donot have a default, animation name is to be specified -->
<!-- In the case of transition, the element stays in the same state once the transition is completed. however in case of animation it flickers back into its original position once the animation transformation is complete.-->
